# Change Log

Please see [here](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc)
for planned releases. 

## 0.2.0 'Interkrillactic, Planetary'

This release focused on testing, and fixing, any issues found when running Krill under various
parent CAs (Apnic, Lacnic and RIPE NCC). ROAs were tested using routinator, OctoRPKI, FORT, RIPE
NCC RPKI Validator 2.x and 3.x.

Furthermore, the CLI got a big overhaul aimed at making it easier to use, especially for users
who manage one CA only. You can now use ENV variables to set defaults for the Krill instance to
connect to, the token, and which CA you want to operate on.

We also added the '--api' argument which will simply print out the API call that the CLI would
have made, without executing it. We plan to add proper (OpenAPI) documentation for the API, but
for the moment this can help to explore it.

Updated documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/index.html).

Known issues:
* Despite our best efforts RIPE NCC RPKI Validator 3.1 is the only remaining RP we tested, which
  does not seem to like our manifests. We will look into this again later. (#115)
* There appears to be a race condition that can cause commands to be processed twice. (#64)
* Showing the full history, or logging it in case of the above condition, uses too much memory. (#112)
* The CA and publication server can be out of sync after a re-start. (#116)

Work for the next release has already started. [Release 0.3](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/projects/6)
will focus on (remote) publication, and will also solve the out-of-sync issue.


## 0.1.0 'A View to a Krill'

This is the first version of Krill that we are testing in the real world. Please note that the
API and data structures have not yet stabilized. 

Features:
* Run an embedded Trust Anchor for testing purposes
* Run a CA under an embedded Trust Anchor
* Run a CA under APNIC (Lacnic, RIPE NCC and other remote parents coming soon)
* Have multiple parent CAs for one logical CA
* Have multiple child CAs, embedded or remote
* Create ROAs based on intent
* Publish locally
* API and CLI

Known issues:
* Krill does not handle concurrent updates well. See this [issue](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/issues/64).
* The UI is very basic and behind the CLI.
